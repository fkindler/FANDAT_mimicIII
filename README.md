# FANDAT_mimicIII

This repository was created as part of the seminar “Fantastic Datasets and Where to Find Them” at Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg. The project involved developing an open educational resource for an influential dataset.

The code used to generate the images featured in the video (TBA) is available here.

The dataset explored in the video is MIMIC-III v1.4:
[Johnson, Alistair, et al. “MIMIC-III Clinical Database” (version 1.4). PhysioNet (2016)](https://doi.org/10.13026/C2XW26)

Code from the original MIMIC-III repository was used as a foundation and adapted or extended as needed:

- [MIMIC Code Repository](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code)
- [Repository for the paper describing MIMIC-III](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-iii-paper)
- [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13374956)
